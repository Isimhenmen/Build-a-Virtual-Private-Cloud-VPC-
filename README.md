#Introducing Today's Project!
What is Amazon VPC?
Amazon VPC is a private section in the cloud that contains your resoures. It is useful
because it helps organisation to conrol network traffic in and out of their resoures in
the cloud.
How I used Amazon VPC in this project
In today's project, I created Amazon VPC and a Subnet. I also created and attached an
internet gateway to my VPC to make it public.
